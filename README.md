# TV-shows-assosiation-rule
This dataset contains details of more than 9000 viewers watching TV shows. Each rows represent the TV shows they have watched together. The dataset was heavily inspired from the famous groceries dataset which is used to learn association rule learning.

Conclusions:

1 The association between "Fringe" and "Lost" is strong, with a high lift value of 11.392405, indicating that these two items are highly likely to be purchased together.

2 Similarly, "Game of Thrones" and "Vikings" are also strongly associated with a lift value of 8.290192, indicating that these two items are highly likely to be purchased together.

3 The lift values for the other associations are relatively lower, indicating weaker associations. "The 100" and "Dark" have a relatively high confidence value of 0.416667, which suggests that if a customer purchases "The 100," they are highly likely to also purchase "Dark."

4 "Punisher" and "Family Guy" have a moderate association, with a lift value of 3.637114 and a confidence value of 0.260116.

5 "Game of Thrones" is associated with both "Family Guy" and "12 Monkeys," with lift values of 3.245980 and 3.757231, respectively, and relatively low confidence values. This suggests that while there is some association between these items, the relationship is not particularly strong.

6 The association between "Arrow" and "The Wire" has a relatively high support value, indicating that these items are frequently purchased together, but the confidence value is relatively low, suggesting that this association is weaker than others in the table.

7 Finally, "Breaking Bad" and "The Wire" have a moderate association, with a lift value of 3.849933 and a confidence value of 0.253086.
